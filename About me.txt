Smart and results-driven software tester with over 2 years of experience in Manual and Automation testing.I am very well grounded in web testing, mobile testing (Android and iOS) and API testing.
An enthusiastic team player and a deep creative thinker. 
One of my core values is not just mindlessly churning out test solutions, but thinking about the short and long term implications of each technical decision, with a major emphasis on the business goals.
